This toolbox uses another toolbox: The CoShREM v11 without compiling the MEX file, since it only uses one of the way to get the shearlet and to have the decomposition.
The functions are also partly inspired by the work of Stephane Roux to get the multifractal spectrum.
Use dwtleader_shearlet to get the multifractal spectrum.
I think this toolbox can be optimized.
